Naive approach
--------------

node *deletehead(node *head){

if(head==NULL)
    return NULL;
if(head->next==head)
    delete head;
    return NULL;
node *curr = head;
while(curr->next = head)
    curr = curr->next;
curr->next = head->next;
delete head;
return curr->next;
}

Efficient approach
-------------------

node *deletehead(node *head){
  if(head==NULL)return NULL;
  if(head->next = head)
      delete head;
      return NULLL;

  head->data = head->next->data; //Copy second node data to first i.e head
  node *temp = head->next; //Store second node to temp
  head->next = head->next->next; //Connect head to third node 
  delete temp; //delete second node
  return head;
}
