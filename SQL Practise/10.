Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Answer(MY SQL):

/*
City name starting with vowels from Station TABLE.
Approach 1 : SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1)) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');
Approach 2 : SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'a%' OR LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'e%' OR LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'i%' OR LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'o%' OR LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'u%';
Approach 3 : SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY REGEXP '^a|^e|^i|^o|^u'
(ere in REGEXP this ^ symbol means word should start from that alphabet AND this | symbol means Bitwise or)
Approah 4 :  select distinct city from STATION where city REGEXP '^[aeiouAEIOU]';
Approach 5 : select DISTINCT(CITY) FROM STATION WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');
*/

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1)) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');
