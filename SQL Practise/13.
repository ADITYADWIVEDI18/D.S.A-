Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LEFT(CITY, 1) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');

Approach 1: select distinct city from station where substr(city,1,1) not in ('a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U'); 
Approach 2 : SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE LEFT(CITY, 1) NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') AND LEFT(CITY, 1) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');
Approach 3 : SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY NOT REGEXP "^a|^e|^i|^o|^u";
( NOT REGEXP means works should not contain specified alphabets )
