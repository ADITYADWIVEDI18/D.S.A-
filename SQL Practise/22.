ANSWER(MY SQL):
WITH
    D AS
        (SELECT NAME, ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS ID 
         FROM OCCUPATIONS 
         WHERE OCCUPATION = 'DOCTOR'
        ORDER BY NAME),
    P AS
        (SELECT NAME, ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS ID 
         FROM OCCUPATIONS 
         WHERE OCCUPATION = 'PROFESSOR'
        ORDER BY NAME),
    S AS
        (SELECT NAME, ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS ID 
         FROM OCCUPATIONS 
         WHERE OCCUPATION = 'SINGER'
        ORDER BY NAME),
    A AS
        (SELECT NAME, ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS ID 
         FROM OCCUPATIONS 
         WHERE OCCUPATION = 'ACTOR'
        ORDER BY NAME),
    H AS
        (SELECT ID FROM D
        UNION 
        SELECT ID FROM P
        UNION 
        SELECT ID FROM S
        UNION 
        SELECT ID FROM A)
        
SELECT D.NAME AS DOCTOR_NAME, P.NAME AS PROFESSOR_NAME, S.NAME AS SINGER_NAME, A.NAME AS ACTOR_NAME
FROM H
LEFT JOIN D ON H.ID = D.ID
LEFT JOIN P ON H.ID = P.ID
LEFT JOIN S ON H.ID = S.ID
LEFT JOIN A ON H.ID = A.ID;
