We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly (salary * months)  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. 
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. 
Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

ANSWER (MY SQL):

Approach 1: 
select * from 
( select (salary*months) AS earnings, 
  count(1) AS res_count
  FROM Employee
  group by (salary*months)
  order by (salary*months) desc
)
where ROWNUM=1;

Approach 2: 
 select 
 max(months*salary),
 (   
     select count(*)
     from Employee
     where (months*salary) = (select max(months*salary) from Employee) 
 ) 
 from Employee;

 Approach 3:
