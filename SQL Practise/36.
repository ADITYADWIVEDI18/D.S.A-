Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345 . Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

Approach 1:
select round(long_w,4)
from station
where lat_n<137.2345 
order by lat_n desc limit 1;

Approach 2: 
select round(long_w,4)
from station
where lat_n in (select max(lat_n) from station where lat_n < 137.2345);

Approach 3:
SELECT CAST(ROUND(LONG_W,4) AS DECIMAL(10,4))
FROM STATION 
WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345 
ORDER BY LAT_N DESC LIMIT 1;

Approach 4:
select round( long_w,4)
from station
where lat_n = (select lat_n from station where lat_n<137.2345 order by lat_n desc limit 1)
order by long_w desc limit 1;
