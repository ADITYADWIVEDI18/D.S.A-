Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Africa'.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

Approach 1:
Select CITY.NAME
From CITY, COUNTRY
WHERE CITY.COUNTRYCODE = COUNTRY.CODE AND COUNTRY.CONTINENT = 'Africa';

Approach 2:(Using JOIN)
Select CITY.NAME
From CITY
Join COUNTRY On CITY.COUNTRYCODE = COUNTRY.CODE
WHERE COUNTRY.CONTINENT = 'Africa';
